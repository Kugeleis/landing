⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks

some color

$${\color{red}Red}$$

$${\color{red}This is a red-colored paragraph. It stands out from the surrounding text due to its vibrant and attention-grabbing color. The use of red can convey various emotions and messages, such as urgency, importance, or warning. When employed effectively, red can create a visual impact and evoke strong reactions from readers. Whether used for emphasis or to convey a specific meaning, a red-colored paragraph can be a powerful tool in communication.}$$
